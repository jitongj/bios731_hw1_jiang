# 731_HW1: Prestige Dataset Analysis

## Dataset Description

This project uses the **Prestige** dataset from the `carData` R package.  
The dataset contains information on 102 Canadian occupations, collected from
the Canadian census and social surveys conducted in the 1960s and early 1970s.
It includes variables related to education, income, gender composition, and
occupational prestige.

In this project, the analysis focuses on **professional occupations only** and
examines how **average years of education** and the **percentage of women in an
occupation** are related to **average income**.


## Project Structure

- `codes/`  
  Contains all R scripts used in the analysis pipeline:
  - `01_data_download.r`: loads the Prestige dataset from the `carData` package and saves the raw data
  - `02_data_cleaning.r`: cleans the data by filtering to professional occupations and selecting relevant variables
  - `03_data_analysis.r`: creates summary tables and fits the linear regression model
  - `04_data_visualization.r`: generates figures showing relationships between income, education, and percentage of women

- `data/`  
  Stores data objects used throughout the project:
  - `raw.Rdata`: original Prestige dataset loaded from `carData`
  - `clean.Rdata`: cleaned dataset used for analysis
  - `analysis.Rdata`: saved analysis outputs, including summary tables and model objects

- `analysis/`  
  Contains the final report and rendered outputs:
  - `final_report.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the full analysis
  - `final_report.html`: rendered HTML version of the report
  - `final_report.pdf`: rendered PDF version of the report

- `results/`  
  Stores figures and other output generated by the final report.


The dataset is loaded directly from the `carData` package using:

```r
library(carData)
data("Prestige")
